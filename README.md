RAK Study Hub: Localized Educational Content Platform

🎯 Problem Statement

Students and teachers in Ras Al Khaimah (RAK) lack a centralized, curated platform for finding educational content (articles, case studies, historical documents) that is specifically relevant and localized to the RAK/UAE context, environment, and curriculum standards. Generic web searches are often too broad and inefficient.

✨ Solution: RAK Study Hub

The RAK Study Hub is a responsive web application designed to fill this gap. It provides a searchable, categorized library of localized educational materials.

Key Innovation: AI-Powered Localization

The application integrates the Gemini 2.5 Flash API to demonstrate advanced technical depth. When a user views an article, they can use the "Ask the RAK Study AI" panel to instantly generate summaries, answer targeted questions about the content, or adjust the complexity of the material, ensuring the information is highly accessible and relevant to their studies.

🛠️ Technology Stack (GitHub Focus)

This project is built using a modern, collaborative stack ideal for open-source development and hackathon presentation:

Technology

Purpose

Demonstrates scalability and database knowledge.

🚀 Getting Started (Simulated Local Setup)

This project is designed as a single-file React component, making deployment and testing extremely simple.

Clone the Repository (Simulated):

# In a real scenario, you would clone the repo
# git clone <your-github-repo>


Run the File:

Since this is a single, self-contained JSX file (StudyHub.jsx), you can place it in a standard React environment (src/App.jsx) or use the provided environment to run the code immediately.

Test the Features:

Search/Filter: Test filtering content by category (e.g., "History") and searching for keywords (e.g., "Julfar").

AI Integration: Click on any content card (e.g., "History of Julfar") and use the "Ask the RAK Study AI" panel to ask a question like "Summarize the major economic activity of Julfar." This demonstrates the live LLM integration.

🤝 Contribution and Collaboration

The open-source nature of this project (designed for GitHub) means we welcome contributions to:

Content Curation: Adding more mock content entries tailored to RAK/UAE curriculum.

Feature Expansion: Integrating a live Firebase backend for user authentication and actual content submission.

UI/UX Improvements: Enhancing the visual design for better mobile usability.

This project was created for the Google-RAK DOK Hackathon 2025-2026.
